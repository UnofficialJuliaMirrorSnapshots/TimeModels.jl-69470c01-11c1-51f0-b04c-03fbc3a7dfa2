### 0.1.0

* Only supports Julia 0.4.x
* Adds exogenous inputs in state space model transition and observation equations
* Allows all system matrices (transition, control input, transition noise covariance,
observation, feed-forward, observation noise covariance) to be time-dependent
* Implements Durbin-Koopman Kalman smoothing algorithm

### 0.0.3

* support floor of Julia 0.3 and non-inclusive ceiling of Julia 0.5-
* only kalman filtering has meaningful tests
